# png-airdrop-offline-signature

## Introduction

[Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/) is a new DEX which debuted on the [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) mainnet on [February 9, 2021](https://twitter.com/pangolindex/status/1359245703592218627). It has offered an airdrop of its PNG token to anyone holding UNI or SUSHI in an Ethereum wallet as of Dec 7, 2020. The [claim process](https://pangolin.exchange/tutorials/claim-png) relies primarily on using MetaMask, which unfortunately doesn't work for Trezor wallets on the Avalanche side. The deadline to claim this airdrop is "one month of Pangolinâ€™s launch" (unclear if this means 30 or 31 days). Its unlikely Trezor will be patched to worked with MetaMask before this deadline. The following tutorial shows how to load a Trezor seed phrase into an offline temporary computer and through a reasonably safe method transfer a signed transaction back to an online computer and publish it to the Avalanche network to claim an airdrop.
