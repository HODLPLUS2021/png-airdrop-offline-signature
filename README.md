# png-airdrop-offline-signature

## Introduction

[Pangolin](https://pangolin.exchange/) is a new DEX which debuted on the [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) mainnet on [February 9, 2021](https://twitter.com/pangolindex/status/1359245703592218627). It has offered an airdrop of its PNG token to anyone holding UNI or SUSHI in an Ethereum wallet as of Dec 7, 2020. The [claim process](https://pangolin.exchange/tutorials/claim-png) relies primarily on using MetaMask, which unfortunately doesn't work for Trezor wallets on the Avalanche side. The deadline to claim this airdrop is "one month of Pangolinâ€™s launch" (unclear if this means 30 or 31 days). Its unlikely Trezor will be patched to worked with MetaMask before this deadline. The following tutorial shows how to load a Trezor seed phrase into an offline temporary computer and through a reasonably safe method transfer a signed transaction back to an online computer and publish it to the Avalanche network to claim an airdrop.

## Requirements

* Computer that can be booted by USB flash drive
* USB flash drive loaded with 64-bit [Xubuntu 20.04](https://xubuntu.org/release/20-04/)
* Cell phone with [Google Lens app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.lens&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Prepare Python and segno QR Code Programs

Boot computer with USB Flash drive loaded with Xubuntu 20.04. Machine should be connected to the Internet for the beginning steps:

```bash
cd  # start in home directory
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git python3-dev python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/heuer/segno.git  # segno==1.3.2.dev0 at time of writing
cd segno  # return to home directory
python3 setup.py install
cd
pip3 install web3  # 5.16.0 at time of writing
python3
```
You should now be in a Python 3.8 interactive session.

## Load Web3 and Pangolin Claim Contract

The following will be a pain to type in, but its worth it to do manually for good security.

```python3
from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider
claim_abi = """\
[
  {
	"inputs": [],
	"name": "claim",
	"outputs": [],
	"stateMutability": "nonpayable",
	"type": "function"
  }
]
"""
provider = HTTPProvider("https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc")
w3 = Web3(provider)
pangolin = w3.eth.contract(address="0x0C58C2041da4CfCcF5818Bbe3b66DBC23B3902d9", abi=claim_abi)
```
